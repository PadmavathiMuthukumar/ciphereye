🔒 Encrypted Traffic Threat Detection with AI & Quantum-Safe Security
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting malicious patterns in encrypted network traffic without decrypting the payload. By leveraging metadata features and advanced ML models (Transformers, GNNs), the system ensures privacy preservation while enabling real-time threat detection.

A Quantum-Safe Security layer (QKD) is integrated to future-proof the system against post-quantum threats.

🚀 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection

Capture encrypted traffic traces using:

Wireshark

CIC-IDS datasets

Custom packet captures

Collect only metadata (packet size, timing, TLS handshake info).
✅ Payload remains private (no decryption needed).

2️⃣ Feature Extraction

Extract key features:

Packet size distribution

Inter-arrival time

Flow duration

Number of packets per flow

TLS handshake patterns

Convert traffic into structured sequences for ML input.

3️⃣ Preprocessing

Normalize and scale features.

Handle class imbalance (malicious < normal).

Format data for ML models.

4️⃣ ML / AI Model Training

Train on metadata with:

Transformer / Graph Neural Network (GNN)

Baselines: Random Forest, XGBoost

Objective: classify flows as Normal / Malicious / Suspicious.

5️⃣ Quantum-Safe Security Integration

Apply Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange.

Ensures post-quantum security resilience.

6️⃣ Threat Detection Engine

Perform real-time anomaly detection.

Flag suspicious flows without decrypting payloads.

Send alerts to SOC (Security Operation Center).

7️⃣ Evaluation & Results

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

Benchmark against existing approaches.

Demonstrate:

🚀 Higher detection accuracy

🔐 Privacy preserved
